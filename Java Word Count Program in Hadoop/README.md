## Steps to run the word count code in Hadoop

- Go to hduser <br /> 
![hduser](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/1.png)
- Go to directory where Hadoop is installed <br /> 
![hadoop directory path](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/2.png)<br />
![path contents](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/3.png)
- Create a new directory to write the word code <br />

- Inside the directory create the java code for word count.

- Type-in the code and save the file
![code](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/6.png)
- Next, assign the java path to Hadoop class path
![classpath](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/7.png)
- Give read and write access to the folder so that code can be compiled
![permission](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/8.png)
- Compile WordCount.java and create a jar
![compile](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/9.png)
![jar](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/10.png)
- All the compiled files and the jar file in the directory.
![class file](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/11.png)
- Create a file in the input directory
![input file](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/12.png)
- The contents of the input file
![content](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/13.png)
- Run the code
![run code](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/14.png)
![code processing](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/15.png)
- Output directory
![output folder](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/16.png)
- Open the part-00000 file to see the results
![output](https://github.com/prateekkr94/Project-Work/blob/master/Java%20Word%20Count%20Program%20in%20Hadoop/Screens/17.png)
